## __Probiotic treatment induces sex-specific neuroprotection after traumatic brain injury in mice__
Code base used to decipher relationships between TBI, probiotics, and the gut microbiome.

In this research study we used short-read V1-V3 16S sequencing, processed the fastq data data using [nf-core ampliseq v2.8](https://nf-co.re/ampliseq/2.8.0/docs/usage) as well as some custom R scripts for data analysis and visualization.

For more information on the microbiome analysis used in this project please see our vignette that can be found [here](https://villapollab.github.io/pan_probiotic_tbi).
